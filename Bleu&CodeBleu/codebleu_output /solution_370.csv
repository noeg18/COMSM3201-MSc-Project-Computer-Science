# Explanation:
# The function takes in a tuple as an argument and uses the built-in sorted function to sort the tuple based on the second element (index 1) of each item in the tuple.
# The key parameter allows us to specify a function to be used for sorting, in this case, we use a lambda function to access the second element of each item in the tuple for comparison.
# The sorted function returns a new sorted list, without modifying the original tuple.
# This function can be used to sort tuples containing any type of elements, as long as the second element is a float.",3
